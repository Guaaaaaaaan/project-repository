            <div class="info-box hide-small">
                <p><strong>Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried in a wok or a frying pan and is usually 
                    mixed with other ingredients such as eggs, vegetables, seafood, or meat. It is often eaten by itself or as an 
                    accompaniment to another dish. Fried rice is a popular component of East Asian, Southeast Asian and certain 
                    South Asian cuisines, as well as a staple national dish of Indonesia. As a homemade dish, fried rice is typically 
                    made with ingredients left over from other dishes, leading to countless variations. First developed during the 
                    Sui Dynasty in China and as such all fried rice dishes can trace their origins to Chinese fried rice.

            <div class="info-box hide-small">
                <p>Genshin Impact is an action role-playing game developed and published by video game company miHoYo. It was released
                     for Microsoft Windows, Playstation 4, iOS, and Android in 2020, and on Playstation 5 in 2021. The game is also set for 
                     release on Nintendo Switch. The game features an anime-style open-world environment and an action-based battle system using 
                     elemental magic and character-switching. The game is free-to-play and is monetized through gacha game mechanics where players
                      can obtain new characters and weapons. The base game is expanded on a regular basis through patches using the games as a service model.
