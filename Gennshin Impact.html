                        distinct nations, each of which is tied to a different element and ruled by a different god. 
                        The story follows the Traveler, who has traveled across countless worlds with their twin sibling 
                        before becoming separated in Teyvat. The Traveler travels in search of the lost sibling with their 
                        companion Paimon and becomes involved in the affairs of Teyvat's nations.

                        <p>Players can select four characters at a time (a total of four characters for all players in online mode) 
                            to participate in the battle, and can switch quickly during the battle. Each character has two skills,
                             elemental combat skills and elemental burst. Elemental combat skills can be activated as long as the cooldown 
                             of the moves expires. The casting of elemental bursts requires accumulation of elemental energy, and they are all cast 
                            in the form of elements. In addition, for characters such as Amber and Gan Yu who use bows as weapons, there is an 
                             aiming mode that is used as a separate attack method, and the normal attacks of these characters are automatic aiming,
                          but the damage is weak.
